# Node.js Fundamentals

### 1. What is Node.js, and how does it work?
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side, using the V8 engine to run code outside the browser.

### 2. Explain the event-driven, non-blocking I/O model in Node.js.
Node.js uses an event loop to handle I/O operations asynchronously, allowing it to process multiple tasks without waiting for any single operation to complete.

### 3. What are the differences between Node.js and traditional web server models (like Apache or Nginx)?
Node.js is event-driven and handles requests asynchronously, whereas traditional servers like Apache or Nginx are thread-based and may block on I/O operations.

### 4. How does the V8 engine work in Node.js?
The V8 engine compiles JavaScript into machine code, enabling Node.js to execute JavaScript with high performance.

### 5. What is the role of the package.json file in a Node.js project?
`package.json` contains metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and configuration for npm.

### 6. Explain the purpose and use of npm (Node Package Manager).
npm is the default package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to install, update, and manage project dependencies.

# Asynchronous Programming

### 1. How do you handle asynchronous code in Node.js?
Asynchronous code in Node.js can be handled using callbacks, Promises, or `async/await`.

### 2. What are callbacks, and how do they work in Node.js?
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are executed once the asynchronous operation completes.

### 3. Explain Promises and how they improve asynchronous code handling.
Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and provide cleaner, more readable code than callbacks.

### 4. How does async/await work in Node.js?
`async/await` syntax is built on top of Promises and allows asynchronous code to be written in a more synchronous style.

### 5. What is the "callback hell," and how can you avoid it?
Callback hell occurs when nested callbacks make code hard to read and maintain; it's avoided by using Promises or `async/await`.

# Event Loop

### 1. Describe the Node.js event loop.
The event loop continuously checks for asynchronous events and processes them, allowing Node.js to perform non-blocking operations.

### 2. How does the event loop manage asynchronous operations in Node.js?
The event loop delegates asynchronous tasks to the system kernel or background threads, and when complete, their callbacks are pushed to the event queue.

### 3. What are the phases of the event loop?
The phases include timers, I/O callbacks, idle/prepare, poll, check, and close callbacks, each handling specific types of tasks.

### 4. How does the event loop affect performance in a Node.js application?
The event loop ensures efficient handling of I/O operations, but blocking the loop (e.g., with heavy computation) can degrade performance.

# Modules and Packages

### 1. What are Node.js modules, and how do you create them?
Modules are reusable pieces of code in Node.js, created by exporting objects, functions, or values from one file and importing them into another.

### 2. Explain the difference between CommonJS and ES6 modules.
CommonJS uses `require()` for imports and `module.exports` for exports, while ES6 modules use `import` and `export` statements.

### 3. How does the module caching mechanism work in Node.js?
Node.js caches modules after the first time they are loaded to improve performance, avoiding repeated loading.

### 4. What are some commonly used Node.js built-in modules?
Common built-in modules include `fs` (file system), `http`, `path`, and `os`.

# File System and Streams

### 1. How do you handle file operations (read, write, delete) in Node.js?
File operations are handled using the `fs` module, which provides synchronous and asynchronous methods for reading, writing, and deleting files.

### 2. Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous file operations.
Synchronous operations block the event loop until they complete, while asynchronous operations allow other tasks to be processed in the meantime.

### 3. What are streams in Node.js, and how do they work?
Streams are continuous data flows that allow data to be processed in chunks, improving performance for reading/writing large files.

### 4. How do you handle large files using streams in Node.js?
Large files are handled using readable and writable streams, which process data in smaller chunks instead of loading the entire file into memory at once.
